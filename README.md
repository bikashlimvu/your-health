HTML website

## Observations 

I personally thought the website would benefit from being a single page website with Home, About us and Contact being different sections. However, as mentioned in the brief, I have gone ahead with 3 different pages on the website.

## Limitations
Some of the limitations on the project are as follows:

*	Small content.
*	Few number of assets.
*	Less technical details such as website layout, styling etc.

## 3rd party Javascript
- Name: Flickity Slider
- URL: https://flickity.metafizzy.co
- Reason: It is easy to implement, flexible and responsive carousel. Also, customizing the carousel to suit the website theme is very easy - with its available pre-built options.
